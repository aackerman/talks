JavaScript to JavaScript Compilation

I just saw an interesting tweet last week. Babel is one year old now. And this is my second talk including Babel this year. Maybe you saw my other talk on Babel at Minnebar, it was mostly to discuss why you might want to use Babel and all of the nifty integrations with all of the other possible build tools. I'm going to discuss some of the same today but I'm also going to discuss some other tools, and some trends that I'm seeing about compiler tools across languages and communities.

If you're here and you're hearing about Babel or compilers for the first time today. Compilers take source code and transform that text into other code. GCC is a C++ compiler it transforms C++ source into machine code. CoffeeScript is a popular to-JavaScript compiler. CoffeeScript defines it's own syntax and semantics that looks like a mish-mash of JavaScript and Ruby, reads this code and transforms that into JavaScript source code. Babel is a compiler as well. It takes JavaScript code and outputs different JavaScript code.

There have been several future JavaScript syntax compilers. Arguably, Babel is now the de facto standard.
Other JS-to-JS compilers: esnext, esnow, es6-module-transpiler, traceur-compiler, jstransform.
