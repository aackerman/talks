						I'm Aaron Ackerman.

						You can find me on twitter and github at the addresses on these slides.

						I'm here today because I wanted to share with everybody here my experiences working with electron and shipping a product. I recently left Code 42, but while I was there I spent several months building and shipping a product through its initial release and two subsequent releases over the course of a year.

					<p>What is electron?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A collection of open source technologies</li>
						<li>An ecosystem of tools</li>
						<li>An interface to native APIs</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Electron is both a collection of open source technologies as well as an ecosystem of tools. When you think about Java, JavaScript or Node.js you can't discount the entire community of tools built up aroud it. That's electron in the abstract.

						More concretely electron provides access to native APIs.
